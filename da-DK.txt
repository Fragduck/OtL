  "Instructions.GeneralGuide.Par1": "<b> Welcome to 911 Operator! \n</b>\n\nThis is a game where you become the call-taker of the 911 emergency line and a dispatcher of emergency services in a city. \n\nYour main objective is to manage the teams of <b>Police Officers</b> (BLUE), <b>Medics</b> (WHITE) and <b>Firefighters</b> (RED) to the emergency events (INCIDENTS) that are represented by corresponding BLUE/WHITE/RED icons.\n\nThe gameplay is divided into two modes - <b>Management</b> and <b>Duty</b>. \n\n<b>Duty mode</b>\nDuty represents a day of the operator's work. During the duty mode your job is to answer 911 calls and dispatch emergency services to the appropriate location. Together with the calls, you also receive other reports either from your Units on patrol or other operators.\n\n<b>Management mode</b>\nIn Management mode you can recruit additional team members, buy vehicles or equipment, organize your squads and check statistics.\n\nThe most important statistic of the game is <b>Reputation</b>, which goes up every time you successfully resolve a call or report, and goes down each time someone dies, criminals escape, or you fail to resolve an incident within the given time. Sometimes ignoring a call might have a positive impact on your Reputation (for example if it is a non-emergency call).\n<b>Be careful!</b> If your Reputation level drops below zero after a duty, you will fail that duty and the game will load the last save point.\n\nAnother statistic is <b>Finances</b>.  You have a few sources of income: \n<b>Base income</b> (for each duty)\n<b>Rewards</b> (for saving lives or avoiding major failures)\n<b>Bills</b> (for giving the tickets for reported minor offenses like speeding)\nYou also need to pay <b>salaries</b> for your staff, which is your main expense.",

Chicago is also a diverse, multicultural city with large Irish, German and Polish communities.\n\nChicago also has a reputation for organized crime going back to the \"Roaring Twenties\" and the infamous gangster Al Capone.
